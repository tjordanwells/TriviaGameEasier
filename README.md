# TriviaGameEasier

This is a simple trivia game that utilizes javascript and jQuery to manipulate the application's time.

The user will have 2 minutes (120seconds) to complete the quiz. If the timer runs out, the quiz form will score itself and alert the user of their score. 

If the user finishes the quiz before the time runs out, they can click the "Submit Quiz!" button to score the quiz as well.
